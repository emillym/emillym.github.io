<p>Now <a href="https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/ghostbusters/">make your own version!</a></p>
	<h2 id="trinket">Trinket</h2>
	<p>Find Trinket at <a href="https://trinket.io/">https://trinket.io/</a></p>
			<p>Trinket is an embeddable editor. It means that you can edit your code and see a live preview. We use trinket with the HTML/CSS projects and also with the Python projects. You can log into Trinket and save your code, allowing you to keep working on it at home. Trinket also allows remixes, like Scratch, to customise and redesign a template project.</p>

	<h2 id="html">HTML/CSS</h2>
	<p>Find Code Club's HTML/CSS projects at <a href="https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/webdev/">https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/webdev</a>
	<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
			<p>Hyper Text Markup Language. Every website uses HTML to tell the browser how to display text and images.</p>
			<p>Right Click on this webpage (or any webpage!) and View Page Source. This is the raw html that the website is made up of!</p>
			<p>You can also use Developer or Inspect Element (depending on your browser) to view the html in a slightly nicer format.</p>
	<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>
			<p>Cascading style sheets. CSS is used for formatting groups of webpages; you can do a fair bit of formatting just in HTML but CSS allows you to use one file for a whole website, instead of inserting it in every page. CSS also gives you a few extra formatting options that aren’t available in HTML.</p>
			<p>You can see some CSS by right clicking and choosing Inspect Element. Go to sources and find a css file. You can then view the CSS file in the Console.</p>
	<p><strong>Code Club Projects</strong></p>
			<p>The projects are all simple websites, although they increase in complexity as the term goes on. If you finish the whole term you will have created and practised webpages with:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Links</li>
		<li>Images</li>
		<li>Animations</li>
		<li>Lists and headings – different ways to display text</li>
		<li>Spans, classes, and divs – different ways to label elements of a page, so you can format them</li>
		<li>Embedding resources</li>
		</ul>
	<p><strong>Writing HTML/CSS</strong></p>
<p>You can write HTML and CSS in any text editor, like Notepad.exe. Write the code, save the file as HTML and open it in your web browser to see how it looks. Code Club prefers to use Trinket so that you can see a live preview of the project – see more about Trinket above.</p>
<p><strong>Try it out!</strong></p>
<p>Here is a birthday card.<p>
	<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/html/90506676c9?runMode=autorun" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>If you run through the instructions for the Happy Birthday project, you will get an introduction to HTML and CSS, and also make your own custom birthday card. </p>

<h2 id="further">Where are more resources available?</h2>
		<p><strong>What Code Clubs run in this area?</strong></p>
	<p>Tarneit and Wyndham Vale run Scratch 1 & 2 over repeatedly; Point Cook runs each kind of program (they’ve just finished/just about to finish HTML/CSS and they’ll have Python next term).  </p>
	<p><strong>What else does Code Club have?</strong></p>
<p>As well as Scratch, HTML/CSS and Python, Code Club has resources to help kids learn using various tiny computers – the Raspberry Pi, and the micro:bit. See <a href="https://codeclubprojects.org/">Code Club Projects</a> for more info.</p>
	<p><strong>What other types of program exist?</strong></p>
	<p>There are actually a whole bunch of online programs to help you (or someone else) learn to code.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a></li>
	</ul>
<p>Both of these are aimed at adults. They’ve got stacks of different languages to learn and different kinds of activities to try.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a></li>
		</ul>
<p>This one has activities for very young kids all the way up to university level. Like Scratch, Code.org uses drag and drop blocks to build code, but it starts with small, simple puzzles to get kids used to the idea. </p>
<p>For learning HTML and CSS, the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3schools tutorials</a> are a great beginner's resource. They start from scratch and have a glossary of all the tags, including old ones, and what to use instead.</p>
