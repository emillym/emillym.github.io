	<h1>Hi there, I'm Hank Quinlan!</h1>
	<p>Trinket is an embeddable editor. It means that you can edit your code and see a live preview. We use trinket with the HTML/CSS projects and also with the Python projects. You can log into Trinket and save your code, allowing you to keep working on it at home. Trinket also allows remixes, like Scratch, to customise and redesign a template project.</p>
